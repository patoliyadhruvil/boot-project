                            Hi guys! We were supposed to head to California this weekend but last minute had to cancel and Iâ€™m so bummed <br/>I was so ready for the beach!! These pictures were from last weekend when the weather was so nice! I got <br/> Beckam a bike for his birthday and he ended up loving it so much we go out riding every night its warm enough <br/> to go so I decided to get one for myself too so I could ride with him!
